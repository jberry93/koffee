I chose this site idea because I know how it feels to be removed from
a flow state as a result of a caffeine craving. The flow state is
another way of saying "the zone" which is where a lot of people reach
their peak performance. Creating a service that will not only satisfy
your caffeine cravings but also keep you in the flow state for work
should increase your productivity and allow you to get more done without
having to work your way back into the flow state.

The purpose of this website is a delivery service for caffeine addicts
who are constantly busy

function rather than the form. A clean and modern look was my goal for
this website

The layout of my website is focused on the product of delivering coffee.

My code layout seems pretty straightforward. I made sure to separate my
HTML, CSS, and Javascript files into their respective directories for easier
navigation. I prefer it this way since embedding CSS and/or Javascript into
the HTML file may seem convenient but I would rather be working on just HTML
in a HTML file and CSS in a CSS file. Separating all these components makes
working on them easier
